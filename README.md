nactive subscribers are opted-in contacts with valid addresses who haven't opened or 
clicked your email campaigns in a while. It's helpful to identify and segment your 
inactive subscribers, so you can send a re-engagement campaign to win back their 
interest or remove the inactive addresses from your list.
